    <h2>About The Movie</h2>
    <p style="background-color: bisque;">
    <strong>The Boss Baby</strong> is an animated comedy film that revolves around an imaginative <br>
        and spirited seven-year-old boy named Tim Templeton. Tim's perfect world is <br>
        turned upside down when his parents surprise him with a new baby brother. <br>
        However, this is no ordinary baby; the new arrival, who arrives in a taxi <br>
        wearing a suit and carrying a briefcase, is "The Boss Baby." Unbeknownst to <br>
        Tim and his parents, The Boss Baby is not just a cute infant but a highly <br>
        intelligent and articulate agent from Baby Corp, an organization in the baby world. <br>
        Babies like him possess adult-like personalities and the ability to speak like <br>
        grown-ups, but they remain in their baby form to conduct secret missions.<br>
        The Boss Baby's mission is to infiltrate Tim's home and gather vital information<br>
        on Puppy Co., a rival corporation led by the scheming CEO, Francis E. Francis.<br>
        Puppy Co. is set to launch a new puppy breed so adorable that it will steal <br>
        attention away from babies, causing a potential catastrophe for Baby Corp and<br>
        disrupting the world's balance of love.<br>
        Initially, Tim is resentful of The Boss Baby's intrusion into his life and the<br>
        attention he receives from their parents. But the two brothers are forced to <br>
        work together when they stumble upon Francis' sinister plan. Through their <br>
        amusing and heartwarming adventures, Tim and The Boss Baby learn to appreciate<br>
        each other's unique qualities and form a strong brotherly bond.<br>
        With the help of their playful and imaginative teamwork, they set out to thwart <br>
        Francis' scheme and bring harmony back to the world of babies. Along the way, <br>
        they face challenges, hilarious situations, and even a puppy love triangle.<br>
        
        "The Boss Baby" is a delightful blend of humor, action, and heartwarming moments<br>
        that explore themes of sibling relationships, family bonds, and the imaginative<br>
        world of childhood. The film's clever concept and charismatic performances, <br>
        particularly by Alec Baldwin as the voice of The Boss Baby, made it a hit with<br>
        both children and adults alike. Its success led to the creation of a sequel, <br>
        "The Boss Baby: Family Business," which continued the adventures of the Templeton brothers.
