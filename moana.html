    <h2>About The Movie</h2>
    <p style="background-color: bisque;">
       <strong>Moana</strong> is a heartwarming animated adventure film released in 2016 by Walt Disney Animation Studios.<br>
        Directed by Ron Clements and John Musker, the film is inspired by Polynesian mythology and follows <br>
        the journey of a spirited young girl named Moana Waialiki.<br>
        Moana, the daughter of the chief on the Pacific island of Motunui, has an adventurous spirit and an <br>
        unyielding love for the ocean. Despite her people's long-standing tradition of staying within the <br>
        safety of the reef, Moana is drawn to the vastness of the ocean and dreams of exploring beyond her<br>
        home's boundaries.<br>
        The peaceful life on Motunui is disrupted when a mysterious darkness starts spreading, affecting<br>
        the island's resources and livelihood. Moana's grandmother, Tala, reveals to her the forgotten <br>
        history of their ancestors, who were voyagers and skilled navigators. They had stopped venturing<br>
        beyond the reef due to the loss of their leader, Maui, stealing the heart of Te Fiti, the goddess<br>
        of creation. Tala believes that Moana is destined to restore the heart and save her people.<br>
        Determined to bring back harmony to her island, Moana embarks on an epic quest to find Maui and <br>
        convince him to return Te Fiti's heart. Along her journey, Moana faces various challenges, tests<br>
        her own courage and determination, and discovers her true identity as a wayfinder and leader.<br>
        During her encounters with Maui, who initially resists helping her, they develop a complex <br>
        relationship that evolves as they face various obstacles together. Along the way, Moana learns <br>
        important lessons about self-discovery, the importance of embracing one's heritage, and the <br>
        significance of finding her own way.<br>
        The film's breathtaking animation, powerful music (composed by Lin-Manuel Miranda, <br>
        Opetaia Foa'i, and Mark Mancina), and strong storytelling received widespread acclaim.<br>
        "Moana" is celebrated for its empowering portrayal of a brave and independent heroine<br>
        who defies stereotypes, making it a beloved addition to Disney's animated classics. <br>
        The film's themes of courage, self-belief, and connection to one's roots resonate with<br>
        audiences of all ages, making "Moana" an enduring and cherished tale.
