        <p style="background-color: bisque;"><strong>Think and Grow Rich</strong> is a book written by Napoleon Hill released in 1937 <br>
            and promoted as a personal development and self-improvement book. <br>
            He claimed to be inspired by a suggestion from business magnate and <br>
            later-philanthropist Andrew Carnegie. However there is no evidence that<br>
            the two ever met.The book is considered a classic in the personal<br>
            development genre and has been widely influential in shaping the way<br>
            people think about success and wealth.</p>
