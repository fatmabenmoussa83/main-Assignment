    <h2>About The Movie</h2>
    <p style="background-color: bisque;">
        <strong>Titanic</strong> is a blockbuster romantic drama film released in 1997, directed by James Cameron.<br>
         The film is based on the tragic real-life sinking of the RMS Titanic, a luxurious British <br>
         passenger liner, during its maiden voyage in 1912.       <br>
        The story revolves around two fictional characters: Jack Dawson (played by Leonardo DiCaprio), <br>
        a young and spirited artist from a lower-class background, and Rose DeWitt Bukater (played by <br>
        Kate Winslet), a young upper-class woman who is engaged to a wealthy but possessive man named <br>
        Cal Hockley (played by Billy Zane).       <br>
        Jack and Rose's lives intertwine when they meet on board the Titanic. Despite coming from<br> 
        different worlds, they form an unlikely bond and fall deeply in love, defying the societal <br>
        norms and expectations of their time.      <br>
        However, their romance faces numerous challenges, including the disapproval of Rose's snobbish<br>
         mother and Cal's jealous and controlling behavior. The ultimate test of their love comes when<br>
          the Titanic strikes an iceberg and begins to sink.       <br>
        As chaos ensues on the ship, Jack and Rose fight for survival amidst the unfolding tragedy. <br>
        Their love and courage are put to the test as they navigate through the chaos, helping others<br>
         and trying to escape the doomed vessel.       <br>
        The film weaves a captivating tale of love, sacrifice, and survival against the backdrop of<br>
         one of the most significant maritime disasters in history. "Titanic" received critical acclaim <br>
         for its powerful storytelling, stunning visuals, and outstanding performances from the lead actors,<br>
          Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. It became a cultural phenomenon and went on to become one of<br>
           the highest-grossing films of all time, winning numerous awards, including 11 Academy Awards.
