        <strong>The Picture of Dorian Gray</strong> scandalized readers when it was first <br>
        published in 1890. Written in Wilde’s signature style, the story has<br>
         gone on to become an enduring tale of man’s hubris and narcissism. <br> 
         The well-known artist Basil Hallward meets the young Dorian Gray in the stately <br>
        London home of his aunt, Lady Brandon. Basil becomes immediately infatuated<br>
        with Dorian, who is cultured, wealthy, and remarkably beautiful. Such beauty,<br>
        Basil believes, is responsible for a new mode of art, and he decides to paint<br>
        a portrait of the young man. While finishing the painting, Basil reluctantly<br>
        introduces Dorian to his friend Lord Henry Wotton, a man known for scandal <br>
        and exuberance. Wotton inspires Dorian to live life through the senses, to <br>
        feel beauty in everyday experience. Dorian becomes enthralled by Wotton’s ideas,<br>
        and more so becomes obsessed with remaining young and beautiful. He expresses <br>
        a desire to sell his soul and have the portrait of him age, while he, the man, <br>
        stays eternally young. A tragic story of hedonism and desire,The Picture of Dorian<br>
         Gray is Oscar Wilde’s only published novel.
