            <strong>The Power of Positive Thinking</strong> A Practical Guide to Mastering the Problems <br>
           of Everyday Living is a 1952 self-help book by American minister Norman Vincent Peale. <br>
           It provides anecdotal "case histories" of positive thinking using a biblical approach,<br>
           and practical instructions which were designed to help the reader achieve a permanent <br>
           and optimistic attitude. These techniques usually involved affirmations and visualizations. <br>
           Peale claimed that such techniques would give the reader a higher satisfaction and quality of life. <br>
           The book was negatively reviewed by scholars and health experts, but was popular among the <br>general
           public and has sold well.</p>
